_Review of Joachim.Henriksen_headbook by Henrik Flo Wilhelmsen (hwi038)_

## 3a) Code review

### Formatting

### First Approach

I began by running the app checking that the app works as its supposed to:

1. Login with username: This worked as expected, and I was able to login with both the users in the database. I also created a new user, and was able to login with this user as well.
2. Then with the new user i tried to add a buddy, but this wasnt implemented yet, so the database was not updated with the new buddy.
3. I wanted to change the password since the new user i created had a password that was copied from another user, but when i tried to change the password, the app crashed. (Internal Server Error), updating the userinfo was not possible
4. I then looked at the commits made by the author, and tried to figure out what the author had done.
   I saw 2 changes in the app.py file, and 1 in the script.js

-   app.py | Added parameterized queries to the get_user function in User class
-   script.js | Added html escape in the format_profile function so that xss would not be possible
-   app.py | Started implementing hash and salt for the password (minor bug)

### Structure

#### Commits

The messages in the commits are good, and the author has written what he has done in the commit messages.

#### Code structure

The code structure is good, and the author has used comments to explain what the code does. The code is easy to read and understand. The author could have used some more comments in the script.js file, but the code is easy to read and understand.

#### Formating

The author has used the same formating in the whole project. The code is easy to read and understand.

### Implementation

#### Parameterized queries, fix for sql injection

The author has implemented parameterized queries inside get_user so we could not SQL inject inside login page, this was done using `?` inside the sql query and the added values in a tuple inside `*args` parameter in the sql_execute function. This is a good way to prevent sql injection, since the values are not directly inserted into the query, but instead passed as a tuple of values. This way the values are not interpreted as sql code and we cannot change the structure of the query with a carefully crafted input.

##### Other sql injection problems

One security problem still arises in User.save()

In the User.save() function, the queries are not parameterized, and the values are inserted directly into the query. This is a problem since the values are not escaped, and can be interpreted as sql code. Since we can trigger the save function in /profile/ and pass in new user values this function is now vulnerable to sql injection. This is only possible in two inputs because of how the values are inserted into the query. All info values is generaly vounerable to sql injection, unless the values in the form has validations. the inputs they are built using json.dump and this makes it a string, and info is passed directly into the query. This is what i have found.

**Not possible:**

1. Password: value is hashed and salted before inserted into the query, this will not generate a valid sql query.
2. Username: value is readonly, and cannot be changed in the profile page.
3. Birthday: value is in a date format, and will be validated before we can save the user and will not generate a valid sql query.
4. Picture: value is validated that its a valid url before it triggers the save function, and will not generate a valid sql query.

**Possible:**

1. About: this is just text passed directly into the query, and can be used to trigger sql injection. We just escape the original json object:

```sql
"}' WHERE 1=2; INSERT into USERS (username, password, info) VALUES ('a', 'a', '{}'); --
```

2. Color:

```sql
"}' WHERE 1=2; INSERT into USERS (username, password, info) VALUES ('c', 'c', '{}'); --
```

**(Fix):** This can be fixed by using prepared statements, and passing the values as a tuple as did in the get_user function. When dealing with user values and sql queries all values should be parameterized, and not inserted directly into the query.

```py
if "id" in self:
  sql_execute(
      f"UPDATE users SET username=?, password=?, info=? WHERE id=?;", (self.username,generate_password_hash(self.password), info, self.id,)
  )
else:
  sql_execute(
      f"INSERT INTO users (username, password, info) VALUES (?,?,?);", (self.username,generate_password_hash(self.password), info,)
  )
```

#### XSS prevention

The author has implemented html escape in the format_profile function in script.js using qhtml, this is a good way to prevent xss, since the values are escaped before they are inserted into the html. This way the values are not interpreted as html code and we cannot change the structure of the html with a carefully crafted input.

Other places where the values are inserted into the html is in the /profile/ route, if you pass in

```html
green"></div>
<img
id="hack"
src=""
alt="hacked"
onerror="
  alert(`Your profile has been hacked!`)
  "
/>
<div style="
```

into the favorite color section this will inject javascript, this javascript will not be triggered when viewing a profile in the homepahe since the values are escaped in the format_profile function. But if you view your own profile, the javascript will be triggered and you will get an alert saying that your profile has been hacked. This is because the values are not escaped in the profile template. you can fix this by changing the favorite color section in the profile template to:

```html
{% extends "_layout.html" %} {% from "_field.html" import render_field %} {% block title %}Edit
profile{% endblock %} {% block head %} {{ super() }}
<script nonce="{{g.csp_nonce}}">
    // This will make sure that we cant inject any html or javascript into the color input field
    // before we added the color field directly inside a the render field  html
    // we could inject html and javascript into the color field
    // now we only set the background color of the color sample div
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
        color_sample = document.querySelector('#color-sample');
        colorinput = document.querySelector('#color');
        color_sample.style.backgroundColor = colorinput.value;
    });
</script>
{% endblock %} {% block content %}
<form class="user" novalidate action="" method="post">
    {{ form.csrf_token }} {{ render_field(form.username) }} {{ render_field(form.password,
    autocomplete="new-password") }} {{ render_field(form.password_again,
    autocomplete="new-password") }} {{ render_field(form.birthdate) }} {{ render_field(form.color,
    '<div id="color-sample" class="color-sample" />') }} {{ render_field(form.picture_url) }} {% if
    form.picture_url.data %}
    <img src="{{form.picture_url.data|safe}}" alt="{{form.username.data}}'s profile picture" />
    {% endif %} {{ render_field(form.about) }}
    <p> {{ form.save }} </p></form
>

{% endblock %}
```

this makes sure that when the dom is loaded, we can set the background color directly into the background color on the color-sample div.

the inline javascript could also be fixed by using content security policy, This way the inline javascript would not be executed. If we still want to run our script tags we need to add nonce to any script tags we want to run.

```py
@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = f"script-src 'self' 'nonce-{g.csp_nonce}'"
    return response
```

This fix would also pevent any javascript injected by other elements either added by inspect element or by other means. This would potentially break helpfull extensions that inject javascript into the page for better userexperiences, but this is a good way to prevent xss.

#### Password hashing

The implementation of password hashing is a good way to save passwords. The author has implemented password hashing using werkzeug.security, this is a good way to hash passwords since it uses a secure hash function and a salt. Even if two passwords are the same, the storing of the same password will not generate the same hash. This is a good way to prevent password leaks, and password rainbow attack.

**(Bug 1)**
One problem that I found was that the sql_execute query in User.save() was not a correct sql query in UPDATE.
(Fix): It was missing singlequotes around the password value. I fixed this and the app worked as expected. I could now update the userdata in route /profile/

```py
sql_execute(
  f"UPDATE users SET username='{self.username}', password='{generate_password_hash(self.password)}', info='{info}' WHERE id={self.id};"
  )
```

Problem arose in [commit 288c4372 | headbook/app.py](https://git.app.uib.no/inf226/23h/assignment-2/Joachim.Henriksen_headbook/-/commit/288c43723a8a88876e094133c99cf7d6de99eb03)

**(Bug 2)**
Since the password is hashed everytime the user updates the profile, the password is hashed again and again. This causes the hashed password to be hashed and then the login will no work since the password is now hashed twice. This is a minor bug, and can be fixed by hashing in the /profile/ route, by setting current_user.password = generate_password_hash(form.password.data) and removing the hash in the User.save() UPDATE sql. Insert can have the hash since the user is new and the password is not hashed yet.

#### Other security problems not concidered

##### Passwords

The validation for new passwords is not implemented, this could make it possible for the user to have passwords that are not secure and easy to bruteforce. The author could have implemented a password validator that checks if the password is secure enough. This could be done by using the [Wtforms validators](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/validators/#wtforms.validators.DataRequired) in the profile form.

##### COOKIES

The author has not implemented secure cookies, and the cookies are not httponly. This could make it possible for an attacker to steal the cookies and impersonate the user. this could have been set in app.config.

### Conclusion

The author has done a good job implementing the security fixes, and the app is now more secure than before. The author could have implemented more security fixes, but the fixes that are implemented are good. The author has also done a good job with the code structure and the code is easy to read and understand.
