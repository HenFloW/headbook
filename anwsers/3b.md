#### Huge changes

##### Moved to seperate files

I moved the entire project to seperate files, we now have a routes folder with all the routes, a modules folder for utils and models and forms folder for forms.
This makes it easier to navigate the project since the files are not as big anymore.

It makes it easier to find the code you are looking for, but it makes it harder to create routes since you have to import a lot of the same modules per route.

##### Added rate limiting decorator

I added a decorator so i can limit the amount of requests that can be made to the server. This is to prevent DDOS attacks and to prevent the server from being overloaded.

You can find the decorator in `modules/rate_limit.py`

how to use it:

this is in the `routes/login.py` file

```python
@rate_limiter(5, "10s")
def try_login(username, password):
    user = user_loader(username)
    if user and check_password(user.password, password):
        # automatically sets logged in session cookie
        login_user(user)
        return user
    return None
```

this will also prevent brute force attacks on the login page.

#### Smaller changes

##### Validation userdata

I added validation to the about info in user, so that the user can't add more than 600 characters to the about field. This is to prevent the user from adding too much text to the about field and potentially break the database with too much text.
