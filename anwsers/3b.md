#### Huge changes

##### Moved to seperate files

I moved the entire project to seperate files, we now have a routes folder with all the routes, a modules folder for utils and models and forms folder for forms.
This makes it easier to navigate the project since the files are not as big anymore.

It makes it easier to find the code you are looking for, but it makes it harder to create routes since you have to import a lot of the same modules per route.

#### Smaller changes

##### Validation userdata

I added validation to the about info in user, so that the user can't add more than 600 characters to the about field. This is to prevent the user from adding too much text to the about field and potentially break the database with too much text.
