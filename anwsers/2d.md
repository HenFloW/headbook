### Vunerabilities

#### Better cookie handling

The cookie handling in the previous exercise was not very good. The cookie was not set to expire, and it was not set to be secure.

-   Session cookie name is set to `headbook-session` to make it easier to identify.
-   Session cookie is set to `Lax` to prevent CSRF attacks.
-   Session cookie secure to make sure it is only sent over HTTPS.
-   Session cookie httponly to prevent XSS attacks.

```py
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_NAME'] = "headbook-session"
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE'] = "Lax"
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True
```

#### Sectret key

The secret key is used to sign the session cookie. This was not set in a good way in the previous exercise.

```py
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```

Now the secret key is either set to the value of the environment variable `SECRET_KEY`, or a random 32 byte string.
To set the environment variable, you can use the `.env` file.

```sh
SECRET_KEY=\<your_secret_key\> # Replace with your own secret key and make it long
```

#### SQL injection vulnerability User

The user login was vulnerable to SQL injection. Since we can update the profile, and the sql_execute function is not a prepared statement, we can inject SQL into the database.
I changed this to use prepared statements, and now it is no longer vulnerable to SQL injection.

```py
def save(self):
    """Save this user object to the database"""
    info = json.dumps(
        {k: self[k] for k in self if k not in ["username", "password", "id"]}
    )

    if "id" in self:
        sql_execute(
            f"UPDATE users SET username=?, password=?, info=? WHERE id=?;", self.username, self.password, info, self.id
        )
    else:
        sql_execute(
            f"INSERT INTO users (username, password, info) VALUES (?, ?, ?);", self.username, self.password, info
        )
        self.id = db.last_insert_rowid()
```

#### Threat model

1. Asset Identification:

-   User account information (usernames, passwords, personal data)
-   Authentication tokens
-   User relationships (buddies)

2. Threat Actors

-   External Attackers: Individuals or groups without prior access to the system.
-   Insiders: Legitimate users or administrators who misuse their privileges.
-   Automated Attack Tools: Bots or scripts that attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities.

3. Potential Threats and Vulnerabilities

-   SQL Injection (SQLi): Since raw SQL statements are being executed, there's a potential risk for SQLi if user inputs are not properly sanitized.
-   Brute Force Attacks: Without rate limiting or CAPTCHA, attackers might attempt to guess passwords.
-   Session Hijacking: If session tokens are intercepted (e.g., via insecure transmission), an attacker could impersonate a legitimate user.
-   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): If user-specific resources aren't properly protected, an attacker could access or modify another user's data.
-   Exposure of Sensitive Data: Passwords and tokens need to be stored securely, preferably hashed/salted for passwords and encrypted for tokens.
-   Misconfiguration: Default or weak configurations can expose the application to various attacks.
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): If user inputs aren't sanitized and escaped, attackers could inject malicious scripts.
-   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Without CSRF protections, attackers could trick users into performing actions without their consent

### Additional features

#### Buddies

I added a buddies feature. You can add buddies, and go to the route `/buddies` to see your buddies and pending requests.

#### Sign up

I added a sign up feature. You can sign up for an account, and then log in with that account.

#### Extra css

I added some extra css to make the site look a bit better.
