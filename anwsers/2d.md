#### Better cookie handling

The cookie handling in the previous exercise was not very good. The cookie was not set to expire, and it was not set to be secure.

-   Session cookie name is set to `headbook-session` to make it easier to identify.
-   Session cookie is set to `Lax` to prevent CSRF attacks.
-   Session cookie secure to make sure it is only sent over HTTPS.
-   Session cookie httponly to prevent XSS attacks.

```py
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_NAME'] = "headbook-session"
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE'] = "Lax"
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True
```

#### Sectret key

The secret key is used to sign the session cookie. This was not set in a good way in the previous exercise.

```py
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```

Now the secret key is either set to the value of the environment variable `SECRET_KEY`, or a random 32 byte string.
To set the environment variable, you can use the `.env` file.

```sh
SECRET_KEY=\<your_secret_key\> # Replace with your own secret key and make it long
```

#### SQL injection vulnerability User

The user login was vulnerable to SQL injection. Since we can update the profile, and the sql_execute function is not a prepared statement, we can inject SQL into the database.
I changed this to use prepared statements, and now it is no longer vulnerable to SQL injection.

```py
def save(self):
    """Save this user object to the database"""
    info = json.dumps(
        {k: self[k] for k in self if k not in ["username", "password", "id"]}
    )

    if "id" in self:
        sql_execute(
            f"UPDATE users SET username=?, password=?, info=? WHERE id=?;", self.username, self.password, info, self.id
        )
    else:
        sql_execute(
            f"INSERT INTO users (username, password, info) VALUES (?, ?, ?);", self.username, self.password, info
        )
        self.id = db.last_insert_rowid()
```
