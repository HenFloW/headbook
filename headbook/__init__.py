# ROUTES – these get called to handle requests
#
#    Before we get this far, Flask has set up a session store with a session cookie, and Flask-Login
#    has dealt with authentication stuff (for routes marked `@login_required`)
#
#    Request data is available as global context variables:
#      * request – current request object
#      * session – current session (stores arbitrary session data in a dict-like object)
#      * g – can store whatever data you like while processing the current request
#      * current_user – a User object with the currently logged in user (if any)
